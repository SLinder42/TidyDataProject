# Codebook For Run_Analysis.R

## Introduction

The following variables are part of the Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data. Each of these represent a column in the tidy data frame. A description of each variable follows their names. Except for the first two variables, the variables refer to signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope signals on a sensor.

##Variables

### Subject ID
Integer in the range of 1 to 30. Represents the subject being tested.
### Activity
String representing the activity during the measurements. Possible values are ""Walking","Walking Upstairs","Walking Downstairs","Sitting","Standing", and "Laying"
